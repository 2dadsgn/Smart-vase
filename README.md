# Smart-vase-webapp
This was just a prototype for an exam project, my goal was to create a web app that could interact with a raspberrypi.
The raspberrypi through the specific sensors for soil humidity and light, gets all those data and send it to the endpoint on a server, the flask app takes this data and show them on the website, each user has his own sensors and plants the database used is MongoDB and the websocket are stored in a different folder this just contains the web APP.

I ve made up a script to can fill the blank database once created,enjoy it.
